        description: "This project will focus on the need to develop a web based application that can monitor the activities of students during an online assessment. Various modalities of data would be explored to find out the best one that helps to achieve the most accurate results. Video data from webcam as well as the screenshots after a fixed interval of time in milliseconds would be analysed to track the Eye Gaze of the user for an efficient suspicion detection. Also the lips would be monitored for talking detection. The application would keep record of all the suspicious activities during the course of online assessment for each student in a database.",

By integrating videocall into buying and purchasing allows the customer to see the product before coming into physical contact with the product.

This e-learning platform powered by cloud computing would allow the independent Learning Management Systems (LMS) embedded in various e-Learning standards to share their learning objects, modules, and content. Basically, cloud computing will encourage the sharing of a wide range of learning objects, allowing learners to access them online easily. The project has a three-layer architecture to facilitate sharing learning modules, reusing them, and interoperability among different learning content efficiently. The middle layer of the infrastructure contains an indexing module and a metadata transformation module to encourage the exchange of metadata among acknowledged e-Learning standards. ",

We are so busy in our daily lives right now that it becomes impossible to keep track of our daily events, meetings, and appointments. To address this issue, this project focuses on developing a Weekly Task Alerting System for Android devices that can alert users of the tasks/appointments that are scheduled for each day in a week. The project is primarily a reminder app powered by an AI chatbot that reminds users of all the tasks that are due daily. Users can use this application to set goals and achieve them, thereby increasing productivity and simplifying their lives.  ",
